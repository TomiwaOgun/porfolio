### Budget Garden
Budget Garden is a Chrome extension designed to help users track their spending and manage their budgets effectively.

It automatically detects purchases on order confirmation pages (currently supporting **Amazon** and **Temu**) and saves the total amount spent.

Users can also manually add expenses, set a weekly budget, and track their remaining funds. As a fun twist, leftover money can be transferred to an in-game currency for a **Budget Garden Game**, where users can "spend" their savings on virtual plants and decorations.

---

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Spending Tracking**: Detects purchases on order confirmation pages and extracts the total amount spent.
- **Manual Expense Entry**: Allows users to manually add expenses for better budget tracking.
- **Weekly Budget Management**: Set a weekly budget and track remaining funds in real-time.
- **Leftover Money Transfer**: Simulate transferring leftover money to a fun in-game currency for the Budget Garden Game.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset the budget and total spent at any time.

# Edge Detection and Line Detection Program

This **C++ program** is designed to perform edge detection and line detection in images using a combination of the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators, followed by the **Hough Transform**. The program processes an input image to detect edges, combines the results of the Sobel and Laplacian operators, and then applies the Hough Transform to identify and highlight the three longest lines in the image. The results are saved as separate output files for further analysis or visualization.

---

## Key Features

1. **Edge Detection**  
   - Combines the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators to detect edges in an image.  

2. **Hough Transform**  
   - Identifies and highlights the three longest lines in the image based on edge detection results.  

3. **Thresholding**  
   - Applies thresholding to the edge detection results to produce binary images.  

4. **Output Files**  
   - Saves the results of each step (Sobel, Laplacian, combined edges, and Hough Transform) as separate .raw image files.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Image Processing**:  
  - Sobel operator  
  - Laplacian operator  
  - Hough Transform  
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing .raw image files  
- **Mathematical Operations**:  
  - Convolution  
  - Gradient magnitude calculation  
  - Trigonometric functions  

---

## What I Learned

- Implementing edge detection algorithms like the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators.  
- Applying the **Hough Transform** to detect lines in an image.  
- Handling binary image data and performing thresholding operations.  
- Writing efficient and modular C++ code for image processing tasks.  
- Debugging and optimizing performance for large image datasets.  

---

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to implement advanced image processing techniques from scratch. It showcases my skills in algorithm design, mathematical computation, and problem-solving, all while delivering a practical tool for edge and line detection in images.  

---

## How It Works

1. **Edge Detection**:  
   - The **Sobel operator** calculates the gradient magnitude to detect edges.  
   - The **Laplacian operator** detects edges by finding areas of rapid intensity change.  
   - The results of both operators are combined, and a threshold is applied to produce a binary edge map.  

2. **Line Detection**:  
   - The **Hough Transform** is applied to the binary edge map to detect lines.  
   - The program identifies the three longest lines based on the accumulator array and highlights them in the output image.  

3. **Output**:  
   - The program saves the results of each step (Sobel, Laplacian, combined edges, and Hough Transform) as separate .raw image files.
