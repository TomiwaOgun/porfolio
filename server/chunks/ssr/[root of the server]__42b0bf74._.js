# Edge Detection and Line Detection Program

This **C++ program** is designed to perform edge detection and line detection in images using a combination of the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators, followed by the **Hough Transform**. The program processes an input image to detect edges, combines the results of the Sobel and Laplacian operators, and then applies the Hough Transform to identify and highlight the three longest lines in the image. The results are saved as separate output files for further analysis or visualization.

---

## Key Features

1. **Edge Detection**  
   - Combines the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators to detect edges in an image.  

2. **Hough Transform**  
   - Identifies and highlights the three longest lines in the image based on edge detection results.  

3. **Thresholding**  
   - Applies thresholding to the edge detection results to produce binary images.  

4. **Output Files**  
   - Saves the results of each step (Sobel, Laplacian, combined edges, and Hough Transform) as separate .raw image files.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Image Processing**:  
  - Sobel operator  
  - Laplacian operator  
  - Hough Transform  
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing .raw image files  
- **Mathematical Operations**:  
  - Convolution  
  - Gradient magnitude calculation  
  - Trigonometric functions  

---

## What I Learned

- Implementing edge detection algorithms like the **Sobel** and **Laplacian** operators.  
- Applying the **Hough Transform** to detect lines in an image.  
- Handling binary image data and performing thresholding operations.  
- Writing efficient and modular C++ code for image processing tasks.  
- Debugging and optimizing performance for large image datasets.  

---

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to implement advanced image processing techniques from scratch. It showcases my skills in algorithm design, mathematical computation, and problem-solving, all while delivering a practical tool for edge and line detection in images.  

---

## How It Works

1. **Edge Detection**:  
   - The **Sobel operator** calculates the gradient magnitude to detect edges.  
   - The **Laplacian operator** detects edges by finding areas of rapid intensity change.  
   - The results of both operators are combined, and a threshold is applied to produce a binary edge map.  

2. **Line Detection**:  
   - The **Hough Transform** is applied to the binary edge map to detect lines.  
   - The program identifies the three longest lines based on the accumulator array and highlights them in the output image.  

3. **Output**:  
   - The program saves the results of each step (Sobel, Laplacian, combined edges, and Hough Transform) as separate .raw image files.
